# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Sandbox

This repository is a collection of mini projects I have worked on to explore and learn about the field of NLP.

## Projects

### Sentiment Analysis
A bag of words implemetation for classifying sentiment in film reviews (following [this tutorial](https://machinelearningmastery.com/deep-learning-bag-of-words-model-sentiment-analysis/))

**Future development:**
* Port for use with [Amazon review dataset](https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/)
* Experiment with vocabulary size
* Experiment with different network architectures
* Experiment with regularisation (per layer or dropout)
